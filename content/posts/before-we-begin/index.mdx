I've been wanting to journal for a while. Mostly because I want to become
a better communicator but also because I've heard it's a good practice for 
mental health.

So I decided to keep it in this website. It's a bit scary – putting your own 
thoughts out there – especially now with the dangers of a connected world and
the perennial nature of the web. I realize that times change, and my context
will influence my thoughts which dooms them to look silly in the future.

I promise myself to write honestly and with my best intentions.
